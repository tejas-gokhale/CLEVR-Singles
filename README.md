# CLEVR-Singles
Dataset generation code for the CLEVR-Singles dataset from the AAAI 2021 paper "Attribute-Guided Adversarial Training" https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.01806

This codebase is directly based on the CLEVR dataset generation code from https://github.com/facebookresearch/clevr-dataset-gen 

Images are rendered by using Blender. Our code works with Blender v2.79b. It may work with other versions too, but I have tno tested it. For specific instructions on installation of Blender and it's Python version, please refer to https://github.com/facebookresearch/clevr-dataset-gen/tree/master/image_generation
